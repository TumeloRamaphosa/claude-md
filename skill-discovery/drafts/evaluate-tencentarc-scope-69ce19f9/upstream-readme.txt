SCoPE adds camera sightlines as positional coordinates to a pretrained video diffusion
transformer. Given a first frame, a text prompt, and a camera trajectory, it generates a video
that follows the requested camera motion while preserving the original image-to-video prior.

## Overview

Video diffusion transformers address their tokens by position on the pixel-time grid: an address
in the tensor, not in the world. The world point a token depicts lies on a surface that has not
been generated yet, but its camera ray is fixed the moment the user specifies a trajectory. SCoPE
therefore treats the ray as a **second positional coordinate**, so camera control becomes a
property of the coordinate system rather than an added module.

The ray is added to the pretrained attention's queries and keys, and the score gains a term that
reads the two rays alone; its canonical form — the reciprocal product of line geometry — measures
how nearly two lines of sight meet. A **Normalize-Gate-Inject** scheme makes a single encoding
trainable across both metric and up-to-scale pose sources. The retrofit keeps RoPE bit-exact,
starts from the unchanged pretrained DiT, and adds under 0.1% new parameters.

In practice this means:

- **Camera motion as coordinates.** Each video token is tied to its camera ray via Plücker
  coordinates; no separate control branch is trained.
- **Robust to heterogeneous pose sources.** The per-clip near-depth normalization plus the learned
  scale gate let SCoPE consume poses from different reconstruction pipelines and scene scales.
- **Self-contained Wan2.2-I2V-A14B release.** The model repository contains everything required for
  inference; users do not need to download a second Wan2.2 checkpoint.

## Installation

SCoPE requires Python 3.11 and a CUDA-capable GPU. The released weights were trained and
evaluated with **PyTorch 2.9.1 (CUDA 12.8)**; because changing the PyTorch version can change the
numerical output, we recommend reproducing this exact environment.

Recommended — [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (resolves the pinned CUDA 12.8 torch build):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TencentARC/SCoPE.git
cd SCoPE
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Alternative — pip with the PyTorch CUDA 12.8 wheel index:

```bash
conda create -n scope python=3.11 -y
conda activate scope
pip install -e . --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```

Optional extras:

- `pip install -e .[viz]` installs matplotlib, needed by the camera-control overlay tool
  `scripts/overlay_camera.py`.
- FlashAttention is optional; the code falls back to PyTorch SDPA when it is not available.

## Model download

Download the SCoPE model from Hugging Face:

```bash
pip install -U huggingface_hub
hf download TencentARC/SCoPE --local-dir checkpoints/SCoPE
```

The checkpoint is approximately 67 GB. Keep both the checkpoint and the Hugging Face cache on
local storage.

## Inference

All inference is driven by `inference.py`. The repository ships example first frames, prompts, and
camera trajectories under `examples/`, so every command below runs out of the box. See
[Inference options](#inference-options) for the full flag list.

### Quick start — choose a trajectory

**Input:** one bundled case.

**Output:** one 81-frame video using the camera trajectory selected in the terminal
(480 × 832, seed 42).

Pass a case without `--trajectory` to see its available camera poses and choose one by number or
trajectory id:

```bash
python inference.py \
  --model_path checkpoints/SCoPE \
  --case omni-misty-forest \
  --output_path outputs/omni-misty-forest__truck_right.mp4
```

The terminal will prompt before loading the model:

```text
Available trajectories for 'omni-misty-forest':
  [1] real_split0_000041  (poses/omni-misty-forest/real_split0_000041.npy)
  [2] real_split0_000081  (poses/omni-misty-forest/real_split0_000081.npy)
  [3] real_split0_000161  (poses/omni-misty-forest/real_split0_000161.npy)
  [4] snake_fwd  (poses/omni-misty-forest/snake_fwd.npy)
  [5] truck_right  (poses/omni-misty-forest/truck_right.npy)
Select a trajectory [1-5] or enter its id: 5
```

| Input first frame | Output (`truck_right`) |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="assets/demo/misty_first_frame.jpg" width="320"> | <img src="assets/demo/forest_truck_right.gif" width="320"> |

The output is shown with the camera-control HUD overlay (see
[Visualizing camera control](#visualizing-camera-control)); the bottom-right inset traces the
driving camera path.

### Specify a trajectory directly

This is the non-interactive form of the same bundled-case inference. Pass the trajectory id
directly for scripts, cluster jobs, and exactly reproducible commands:

```bash
python inference.py \
  --model_path checkpoints/SCoPE \
  --case omni-misty-forest \
  --trajectory truck_right \
  --output_path outputs/omni-misty-forest__truck_right.mp4
```

`bash scripts/inference.sh` wraps this explicit form. It generates the same result as choosing
`truck_right` in the Quick Start selector.

### All trajectories for one scene

**Input:** one first frame + every trajectory bundled for that scene.
**Output:** a series of videos (one per trajectory), generated with a single model load.

```bash
python inference.py \
  --model_path checkpoints/SCoPE \
  --case omni-misty-forest \
  --all_trajectories \
  --output_dir outputs/omni-misty-forest
```

The same first frame driven by all five bundled trajectories. `truck_right` and `snake_fwd` are
synthetic camera paths; **GT 1–3** are the scene's own recorded OmniWorld camera paths (use their
`--trajectory` ids to reproduce them).

| | | |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Input first frame** | **`truck_right`** | **`snake_fwd`** |
| <img src="assets/demo/misty_first_frame.jpg" width="260"> | ![truck_right](assets/demo/forest_truck_right.gif) | ![snake_fwd](assets/demo/forest_snake_fwd.gif) |
| **GT 1** · `real_split0_000041` | **GT 2** · `real_split0_000081` | **GT 3** · `real_split0_000161` |
| ![gt1](assets/demo/forest_gt1.gif) | ![gt2](assets/demo/forest_gt2.gif) | ![gt3](assets/demo/forest_gt3.gif) |

Existing MP4 files are skipped, so interrupted runs can be resumed with the same command.

### Existing case with an external trajectory

Use a bundled case's first frame, prompt, `x_fov`, and `xi`, but drive it with any compatible
local pose file. This avoids copying case metadata or searching for a matching pose directory.

```bash
python inference.py \
  --model_path checkpoints/SCoPE \
  --case omni-misty-forest \
  --camera_path path/to/external_camera_poses.npy \
  --output_path outputs/omni-misty-forest__external.mp4
```

The pose must still use the same `[81,3,4]` or `[81,4,4]` OpenCV camera-to-world convention.
SCoPE validates its shape and finite values before loading model weights. Use `--x_fov` or `--xi`
only when the external camera requires values different from the selected case. `--trajectory`
and `--camera_path` are alternative pose sources and cannot be used together.

### Custom image and trajectory

**Input:** your own first frame, prompt, OpenCV camera-to-world poses, and horizontal FOV.
**Output:** one video following your trajectory.

```bash
python inference.py \
  --model_path checkpoints/SCoPE \
  --input_image path/to/first_frame.png \
  --prompt "A person walks along a misty forest trail." \
  --camera_path path/to/camera_poses.npy \
  --x_fov 1.11847 \
  --output_path outputs/custom.mp4
```

`camera_poses.npy` must have shape `[81, 3, 4]` or `[81, 4, 4]` and use OpenCV camera-to-world
coordinates. `x_fov` is the horizontal field of view in radians. Pinhole cameras use the default
`xi=0`; unified camera models can set `--xi` explicitly.

### Visualizing camera control

**Input:** a generated video + the camera trajectory used to produce it.
**Output:** the same video with a camera-frustum HUD (and optional WASD keys) composited in.

`scripts/overlay_camera.py` derives the overlay from the pose: it renders the accumulated camera
frustum in the bottom-right corner and, for keyboard-style trajectories, the active WASD keys in
the bottom-left corner. At runtime it also prints a lightweight WASD assessment; when horizontal
motion is too small or too few frames map to an active key, it recommends `--hide_wasd`. The
assessment is advisory and does not change the output automatically. Every demo video in this
README was produced with this tool.

```bash
# Camera-frustum HUD only (recommended for scenic / dolly / orbit motions):
python scripts/overlay_camera.py outputs/omni-misty-forest__truck_right.mp4 \
  --pose examples/poses/omni-misty-forest/truck_right.npy \
  --out_dir outputs/overlay --hide_wasd

# Add the WASD key indicator (for keyboard-style / drone trajectories):
python scripts/overlay_camera.py outputs/clip.mp4 --pose path/to/pose.npy --out_dir outputs/overlay
```

Requires the `viz` extra (`pip install -e .[viz]`) and `ffmpeg` on `PATH`.

### Inference options

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--model_path` | `TencentARC/SCoPE` | Local path or Hugging Face id of the SCoPE model. |
| `--manifest` | `examples/manifest.json` | Example manifest for `--case` / `--trajectory`. |
| `--case` | first case | Example case id; when supplied alone, choose its trajectory interactively. |
| `--trajectory` | – | Optional bundled trajectory id; bypasses the interactive selector and is required for non-interactive jobs using `--case`. |
| `--all_trajectories` | off | Generate every trajectory of `--case` (uses `--output_dir`). |
| `--input_image` | – | Custom first frame (with `--prompt`, `--camera_path`, `--x_fov`). |
| `--prompt` | – | Custom text prompt. |
| `--camera_path` | – | External pose `.npy`; use with `--case` or all custom-input flags. |
| `--x_fov` | case value / required for custom | Horizontal field of view in radians. |
| `--xi` | case value / `0.0` for custom | Unified-camera distortion parameter. |
| `--output_path` | `outputs/sample.mp4` | Output file for a single generation. |
| `--output_dir` | `outputs` | Output directory for `--all_trajectories`. |
| `--overwrite` | off | Regenerate existing outputs (`--all_trajectories`). |
| `--negative_prompt` | `configs/negative_prompt.txt` | Negative prompt file. |
| `--seed` | `42` | Random seed. |
| `--cache_dir` | – | Hugging Face cache directory. |
| `--vram_limit_gb` | – | VRAM budget for offloading (enables VRAM management). |

## Training

The public training entry reproduces the RDPO high-noise recipe used for SCoPE: only the
high-noise expert is optimized, and training timesteps are sampled from `[0.9, 1.0)`. The released
mixture concatenates four datasets — RealEstate10K, DL3DV, PanShot, and OmniWorld — each read by
its own native loader in `scope/data/`.

A run is described by a single YAML config:

```bash
python train.py --config configs/train_rdpo_high_only.yaml --num_gpus 8
```

`scripts/train.sh` wraps this command. Multi-GPU training uses FSDP automatically; the model is
large, so multi-GPU training is strongly recommended.

### Training options

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--config` | `configs/train_rdpo_high_only.yaml` | Training YAML (data mixture, trainer, optimizer). |
| `--model_path` | from config | Override the config `model_path`. |
| `--output_dir` | from config | Override the checkpoint/output directory. |
| `--num_gpus` | from config (`8`) | Override GPU count; `>1` enables FSDP full-shard. |
| `--max_steps` | from config (`10000`) | Override the number of training steps. |
| `--resume_from_checkpoint` | – | Resume from an existing checkpoint. |

### Camera convention

Every dataset is normalized with the same convention as RealEstate10K:

1. Poses are OpenCV camera-to-world matrices, expressed **relative to the first camera** (the
   first frame becomes the identity pose).
2. Translation is preprocessed by `trajectory_scale / near_depth`, where `near_depth` is a
   per-clip near-distance depth estimate. This normalization only makes the translation magnitude
   comparable across datasets — absolute scale is handled inside the model by the learned scale
   gate, so `trajectory_scale` stays `1.0` for all datasets.

### Data preparation

Point the config at your local dataset roots, then precompute the per-clip `near_depth` for each
dataset with the shared estimator (RAFT optical flow + two-view triangulation):

```bash
# OmniWorld first needs a validity index over its training windows:
python scripts/build_omniworld_index.py --data_root /path/to/OmniWorld \
  --output /path/to/OmniWorld/valid_entries.json

# Estimate per-clip near-depth for each dataset (repeat per dataset):
python scripts/estimate_near_depth.py --dataset realestate10k \
  --data_root /path/to/RealEstate10K --split train \
  --output /path/to/RealEstate10K/near_depth_train.json
```

The same `estimate_near_depth.py` handles all four datasets via `--dataset {realestate10k,dl3dv,
panshot,omniworld}`. See `configs/train_rdpo_high_only.yaml` for the full list of per-dataset
paths and options (`sample_stride` is random ≤4 for RealEstate10K and 1 for the others).
